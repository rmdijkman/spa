Enable invoking R from JavaScript
Create visualization templates to more easily create visualizations of different types

MINOR FEATURES
- GUIEditor: make sure that setSaved is only triggered when the document is actually changed (not just on key press) 

- StreamEditor: streaming sources are stored with full (platform dependent) filename of the stream, make the filename relative to the path of the stream source
- StreamEditor: there are various moments at which file loading can go wrong, take care of proper error reporting 

- GUIEditor: on close, bring the window that asks to be saved to the front
- GUIEditor: on open, set focus to the textPane, such that text can be entered right away

- Console: on get focus: move cursor to end of document

- Graph: graph windows are never destroyed, just made invisible. This is a potential memory leak. Always keep one in memory to prevent JFX from closing.
- Graph: enable showing errors from html panel (this proves much harder than it would seem)

- VariablesWindow: put functions in a separate list, do not list the contents of the function

- Properties: can return exception on load/save, handle that

MAJOR FEATURES
Replace internal frames with split panes
