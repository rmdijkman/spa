BUGS
- StreamEditor does not mark the file as changed when anything happens

MINOR FEATURES
- StreamEditor: streaming sources are stored with full (platform dependent) filename of the stream, make the filename relative to the path of the stream source
- StreamEditor: there are various moments at which file loading can go wrong, take care of proper error reporting 

- GUIEditor: on close, bring the window that asks to be saved to the front
- GUIEditor: on open, set focus to the textPane, such that text can be entered right away
- GUIEditor (Mac): select all
- GUIEditor (Mac): cut
- GUIEditor (Mac): activate home, end, next word key combinations
- GUIEditor: script pretty printing with colors

- Console: on get focus: move cursor to end of document

- Graph: enable showing errors from html panel
- Graph: graph windows are never destroyed, just made invisible. This is a potential memory leak. Always keep one in memory to prevent JFX from closing.

- VariablesWindow: put functions in a separate list, do not list the contents of the function

- Properties: can return exception on load/save, handle that

MAJOR FEATURES
